# Game of Thrones Survival ⚔️

I **love** Game of Thrones. And I **love** speculating about how long I would survive in a Movie or TV show. So finally we were able to make a website that will create a character based on the user's character traits and then predict how long they would survive in **Game of Thrones**.

We used datasets available on kaggle, and did our own webscraping to enhance those datasets with more information.

After the data cleaning, which was not as easy as expected, as we had to deal with many missing values and duplicates, we moved on to building the quiz to create a character for the user.

models to predict whether the character will die, and if so, in which season.



Additionally, our project involves the development of a storyline and images using generative AI from OpenAI
